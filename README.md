I am Julian and I love playing pokemen go. I also love playing games on my nintendo switch such as super smash bros ultimate. My favorite seasons are summer and fall. I love going to Lehman college because it is easy for me to go to because of where I live in. I love to be home alone and stay outside the building. I like to talk to other people while i am outside. I would like to go out with friends in the future.
